# 1.  General Introduction


## 1.1  PuMuKIT’s overview 

### 1.1.1 Terminology

-   **Series**: Ordered collection of multimedia objects.

-   **Multimedia Objects**: Set of multimedia content, metadata and materials obtained from recording an event. The multimedia object are composed by:
	
    - Several multimedia files: the storage copy with maximum quality (designed as master) and one or several distribution copies with different qualities or codecs.

    - Descriptive metadata, temporal and spatial location metadata, style metadata and access to multimedia object metadata.

    - Metadata to catalogue multimedia object.

    - Metadata of the people that take part in the multimedia object and their roles.

    - Attached materials and URLs that complete the content of the multimedia object.

-   **Web-TV:** The website generated by PuMuKIT.

-   **Metadata:**Editable information of a multimedia object (title, subtitle, keyword, copyright, genre, publish date, recording date, description).

-   **Modules:**Different sections that include PuMuKIT.

-   **ARCA-RSS:** The second publication mode. This data stream format RSS-ARCA generated by PuMuKIT allows that the database with all the audio-visual contents of our institution join a central database, the ARCA server.

### 1.1.2 What is PuMuKIT?

PuMuKIT is an application which can create Web-Tv portals thanks to a powerful backend of administration. PuMuKIT is a platform which allows you to automate the publication process of audiovisual contents produced by an institution or University through the Internet.

PuMuKIT publishes multimedia content stored in its database through different publishing channels such as Web-Tv Portals, different RSS feeds, sites in iTunesU, channels in YouTube or Dspace sites.

The **multimedia object** is the main key of the Web-Tv. This is a set of multimedia contents, its metadata and attached materials obtained from recording an event. Multimedia objects are composed of:

-   Several multimedia files: the storage copy with maximum quality (designed as master) and one or several distribution copies with different qualities or codecs.

-   Descriptive metadata, temporal and spatial localization metadata, style metadata and access to multimedia object metadata.

-   Metadata to catalogue multimedia objects.

-   Metadata of the people that take part in the multimedia object and their roles.

-   Attached materials and URLs that complete the content of the multimedia object.

Multimedia objects with a common topic are gathered in series. A series can be considered as an organized collection of multimedia objects. ***All multimedia objects belong to a series***.

The Web TV application is made up of several applications:

-   **FRONTEND**: Public portal where users can surf the series and see
    the videos. (http://{MyPuMuKIT\_IP}/)

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m25972adc.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 1. PuMuKit’s frontend</font></div>


-   **BACKEND**: Private portal of administration where multimedia
    contents of the database are catalogued and published. It also
    allows you to modify the configuration and appearance of the Web
    portal. (http://{MyPuMuKIT\_IP}/admin)

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m44fbcb69.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 2. PuMuKit’s backend</font></div>


The backend, or application of administration, is a modular Web and an interactive application with two main functions: administrating and cataloguing. It has a private access. Thus, it’s necessary to be registered and to initialize a session. Due to these two functions, the backend is used by two types of users:

-   **Content administrator**: he is in charge of configuring the users with access and their priorities, the real-time channels, the news and the design of the Web portal.

-   **Publisher**: he is in charge of administrating the series and multimedia objects employed as sources in the application of publication.

This application is divided into independent modules. These modules can have a section associated and share a common layout. This layout contains a header, an access menu to different modules and a link to logging off and closes the application.

# 2. PuMuKIT User Manual

## 2.1. Content Import

### 2.1.1. Manual import of mono-stream content

Multimedia objects and series are created from the administration portal inside the module "Multimedia series". To automate the process there is a wizard that guides you through the steps for creating and cataloging content. This wizard will start after clicking the button "Wizard" next to “Create a new series” button, as shown in the picture below:

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_2fab8148.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 4. Wizard button</font></div>


This wizard is composed of three steps:

-   **STEP 0**: The wizard will show you a new window to complete the metadata title and description of the series that will contain the new multimedia object. If the wizard is run from within an existing series this step will not be displayed and the new media object is stored in said series.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m23c5cf20.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 5. Wizard Step 1</font></div>


-   **STEP 1**: In this step, you can select if you want to upload one single multimedia object or a group of them in the series.
    
![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_6aa0e25d.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 6. Wizard Step 2</font></div>


-   **STEP 2**: A window to complete the metadata title, subtitle, description of new object and headline. This step will not be displayed if you select “Add multiple multimedia objects” in the previous step.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_684d7db7.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 7. Wizard Step 3</font></div>


-   **STEP 3**: Finally, a window to complete technical metadata about the publication of the video. The metadata to complete are:

    -   *Master*: Quality video/audio master; you can store a copy of the video to catalog with "master-copy" or compress a bit using "master-video-h264". If the video takes up much space you should use "master-video-h264". You can upload audio files using “master-audio-aac” profile.

    -   *Publication**Channels*: Multimedia channels where newly created object will be published: Web TV, ARCA…

    -   *Priority*: Priority of transcoding. It is used to set the priority of the video in the transcode queue.

    -   *Language*: Audio language of multimedia files being catalogued with the wizard.

    -   *Mode*: The way in which the file is uploaded to create the multimedia object. It may be "Local hard drive" to upload a file stored on the local computer or "Inbox on Server" to select a file stored on the server file.

    -   *Resource (local or server):* Field used to select the local file or server, depending on the selected mode.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m3ce9bdda.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 8. Wizard Step 4</font></div>


-   **FINAL STEP**: This window shows the result of the wizard and it allows you to choose some actions:

    -   See Multimedia Object data

    -   Create another Multimedia Object in same Series

    -   Create another Multimedia Object in a new Series

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m3ac7e07c.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 9. Wizard Final Step</font></div>


After completing the wizard, the multimedia object with the specified metadata is created, the file is transcoded, catalogued and when it ends you can see in the "Multimedia" tab on the block “Video Files”.

### 2.1.2 Importing videos from Opencast

Once the video processing has finished in Opencast, click on the “Ingester” module to go to the next window:

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m32076da.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 10. Opencast Ingester module</font></div>


A list of the videos already processed in Opencast can be seen sorted by recording date.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_71e2c3e.png)

Information showed about the video:

-   Opencast id.

-   Title of the video in Opencast.

-   Opencast series name.

-   Duration of the video.

-   Recording date.

-   “Import” (or “Imported”) and “play”. Click on “play” to open a window with the playback of the video in Opencast. Click on “import” to add the video to its corresponding series and ready to be edited, changing its state to “Imported”. Click on “Imported” to go to the PuMuKIT series where the video is placed (see sections 2.1.2.1, 2.1.2.2 and 2.1.2.3).

There is also a searcher that allows us to find videos sorted by any of the Opencast data (presenter, title, id…).

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m4b356bdf.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 11. Opencast Ingester video searcher</font></div>


When importing the video, the program will behave differently depending on which of these cases is true:

-   It is the first imported video of the series.

-   There are already more videos of the series.

-   The video doesn’t have a series in Opencast.

#### 2.1.2.1 First video of the series

In this case, a new series will have been created in PuMuKIT associated to the Opencast series (from now on all the videos from that Opencast series will be imported in this series).

In this case, the data of the series in PuMuKIT and the metadata of the video must be edited. Both the series and the video will keep some of the data they had in Opencast: title, description, date... However, other fields must be filled in, like person, photo…

In series with more than one video, it is recommended to edit the default values of the multimedia objects before importing the rest of the videos of the series.

#### 2.1.2.2 More videos of the same series

In this case, it is only necessary to edit the metadata of the video (because the series will be already created in PuMuKIT). The generic data of the series will be updated automatically when importing the video and will also keep the data from Opencast: title, description, date...

#### 2.1.2.3 Videos without a series in Opencast

In this case, a new series (“MediaPackages without series”) without any kind of information will be created in PuMuKIT. (See more in editing metadata of a series).

If you don’t edit any metadata of this series, the following videos without a series in Opencast will be added to this series after import them. When you edit any metadata of this default series, another series with this name will be created with the following video imported.

If you wanted to move the video to other series, you would have to select the video, cut the multimedia object, go to the new series and paste it there.

## 2.2 Metadata edition

### 2.2.1 Series metadata edition

The administration of all series is made in their module. This module has two utilities:

-   *Administration*: Creating, deleting and editing the series in which multimedia objects are catalogued in the application.

-   *Access*: This utility provides access to the administration module of the multimedia objects of each series. Multimedia objects are not administrated all together at a time. Instead, the series are listed in the administration module. Using this utility, one series can be selected and a list with the objects of that series will be accessed. This means that, in the administration module of multimedia objects, you can only administrate the multimedia objects of a series.

The administration interface of the series of multimedia objects is divided into: listing of series in pages, previewing of the selected series, filtering form and administration form of the selected series.

In contrast with the other modules, whereas those appeared when it’s necessary in a higher layer in a modal way, in this module and the one of multimedia objects, the form is shown permanently on the bottom of the interface. This enables a faster access.

The listing of series is the main part of the interface and is made up of a table with a row for each entry. It is very easy to use due to the division in pages used, the filtering and the management of data. The listing includes pages to guarantee a good performance of the application, because you can only obtain the data of the rows shown in the current page. It also allows a good usability because you can manage even a list with millions of rows with the help of the previous/net
buttons to access pages one at time.

You can select the number of videos shown in each page.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_32f3b410.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 12. Page buttons</font></div>


The columns which form the header of the table are links that you can use to rearrange the data in the listing in several ways: in ascending or descending order of according the title of the series, the date of publication or the number of multimedia objects it has. To change this order, you simply have to click on the header of the column you want to
arrange in ascending order. If it was already arranged according to this column, data will be arranged in a descending order. In each entry of the table, the following columns are detailed, as it’s shown in this image.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m6cae0a38.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 13. Multimedia series's column options</font></div>


-   *Checkbox* to simultaneously delete several series.

-   *Newness indicator*: A blue «A» indicates that the series is announced and a grey «A» that the series has just some multimedia object announced.

-   *Broadcasting of the series indicator*. The broadcasting of a series depends on the broadcasting of their multimedia objects. It allows to modify the broadcasting of every multimedia object of the series simultaneously, e.g. to move all the multimedia objects from “Blocked” to “Published”.

-   *Edition of the series button*.

-   *Link to videos*: access to the edition module of multimedia objects which belong to a series. If you make double click in the row of a series, you can also have access to the module of the edition of multimedia objects. Thus, the accessibility is increased.

-   *Thumbnail*: represents a series.

-   *Title of the series*.

-   *Date of publication* of the series.

-   *Number of multimedia objects* in the series.

Thanks to the filters, you can see fewer results and obtain quickly what you are looking for. You can configure the filters with a form. In this form, you can create filters depending on the title, involved people, recording places, channels, broadcasting, states… To reduce the size that may occupy the form if all configuring fields are shown the form
has the shape of an accordion. Therefore, the usability of the system is improved. Each brand of the accordion is shown separated from the next image. The fields of the filtering form are case or accent mark insensitive and use "\*" as wildcard character.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m98064fc.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 14. Multimedia series's filters</font></div>


If you make double click on an item of the list of series, you have access to the edition module of multimedia objects which belong to that series. With one click, you select the item in the list of the selected series. Inside all the different metadata of the series structure, which you can modify through the form, we can distinguish two types: firstly,
the descriptive metadata of content such as title, subtitle, etc. And, secondly, the metadata representing the portal as design, header of HTML

As it’s shown in the image, there are the following fields:

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_5bc6c027.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 15. Multimedia series's info edition form</font></div>


-   *Title*: Field of text which can be adapted internationally. It is used to insert the title of a series and it’s mandatory.

-   *Keywords*: Field of text which can be adapted internationally and include keywords separated by semicolons. It is used to improve the efficiency of the searches.

-   *Copyright*: Field in which the copyright of the contents of a series is defined.

-   *License*

-   *Channel*: List with the types of series, where you can select the one that correspond with the series. These types of series are administrated with their corresponding module.

-   *Date of publication*: it is initialized on the date of the creation of the series. It’s easy to modify due to a calendar. Its structure is validated.

-   *Description*: Text area which can be adapted internationally and describes briefly the series.

-   *Images*: List of images related to the series. You can modify the order, delete or insert new ones. See section 3.2.3.

-   *HTML texts*: In these text boxes, you can add HTML both for the header and footer of the series.

-   *Headline*

#### 2.2.1.1 Edition of the series options

When clicking on the series options icon it will show this option:

-   Delete series: Delete the series and all its multimedia objects. If the multimedia objects are Opencast videos it wouldn’t delete the video, just its importation to PuMuKIT.

#### 2.2.1.2 Videos Template

It allows to set common metadata for every multimedia object of the series. (See section 2.2.2 for further details)

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m281cc647.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 16. Multimedia series’s metadata edition form</font></div>


When creating or importing a multimedia object of the series from Opencast, metadata will be assigned to each one of them, except for the “Description” field. When importing a video from Opencast, the default “Description” field will be used only if the video “Description” field of Opencast is empty, in this case it will keep the metadata.

### 2.2.2 Multimedia object metadata edition

This is a module to administrate multimedia objects of series. You can access through the series administration module and it shows only multimedia objects of series. The title of the series whose objects are administrated is on the interface header and by clicking on it allows you to move back to the module of the administration of series.

The administration interface of multimedia objects is very similar to the series administration module. The interface is divided into the sequential list of multimedia objects, the previewing and the administrator of the selected multimedia object. The order of multimedia objects inside a series is defined by the cataloguer and consequently the list is shown in that way. This module does not have a form to make the filtering because generally a series doesn’t have many multimedia
objects and, making it unnecessary.

In the image you can see in more detail a row of the list of multimedia objects. The following items are included in that:

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_20a2adc2.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 17. Multimedia object's column options</font></div>


-   *Checkbox* to simultaneously delete several series.

-   *Indicator of the multimedia object broadcasting*.

-   *Newness indicator*: A black «A» indicates that the multimedia object is announced.

-   *Delete button*of the multimedia object*.*After confirmation the elimination, a recursive elimination is performed, deleting all video files, materials and images to which the object is related.

-   *Edition button*of the multimedia object. This includes one option: delete.

-   *Buttons to move up*the multimedia object a position or place it the first. It is used to modify the order of multimedia objects of series.

-   *Buttons to move*down the multimedia object or placed it the last. It is used to modify the order of multimedia objects of series.

-   *Thumbnail* which represents the multimedia object.

-   *Title of the multimedia object*.

-   *Recording date* of the multimedia object.

-   *Publication date*of the multimedia object.

Below this list, there is a button to create new multimedia objects inside the series you are administrating and a button to execute the wizard inside the series. There is also a list of rapid-access that allows you to delete, announce and rearrange multimedia objects of series.

When you click on an item of the multimedia objects’ list, this is selected, updating the previewing and the administration section with the contents of this multimedia object. The previewing has a similar design as the block shown in the public web portal when the items of a series are listed. Since the multimedia object is the core part of the database, the administration section now is very big. Therefore, it is divided into five tabs: publication metadata, descriptive metadata,
tags, people and technical metadata.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m33e5f137.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 18. Multimedia object's metadata tab</font></div>


#### 2.2.2.1 Publication metadata

Tag with metadata related to the publication of a multimedia object:

-   *Status*: It indicates the state of a multimedia object. The states are “Published”, "Blocked" or “Hidden”. See section 2.3 Content publication.

-   *Publication channels*: a set of options which allow you to publish a multimedia object in the different channels. See section 2.3 Content publication.

-   *Publishing decisions*: Set of selectors that allow to catalogue the multimedia object by globalizing it into one category as the frontend of the website is displayed

-   *Broadcast profile*: With this, you indicate the ACLs of the video.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_14aa138b.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 19. Multimedia object's publication tab</font></div>


#### 2.2.2.2 Descriptive and style metadata

The tag of descriptive and style metadata which is shown in the next image is made up of a form with the following fields:

-   *Title*: Field of text which can be adapted internationally. It’s used to insert the title of a multimedia object and it’s mandatory.

-   *Subtitle*: Field of text which can be adapted internationally. It’s used to insert the title of a multimedia object, if this has one.

-   *Keywords*: Field of text which can be adapted internationally and include keywords separated by semicolons. It’s used to improve the efficiency of the searches.

-   *Copyright*: Field in which the copyright of the contents of a multimedia object is defined.

-   *License*

-   *Public date*: Publication date of multimedia objects. It is initialized on the date of the creation of the series. It’s easy to modify due to a calendar. Its structure is validated.

-   *Record date*: Recording date of the multimedia object. It is initialized with multimedia object’s creation date. It’s easy to modify due to a calendar. You have to make sure this date is not bigger than the publication date and it has a valid format.

-   *Description*: Text area which can be adapted internationally and describes briefly the multimedia object.

-   *Headline*

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m1e20cbe8.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 20. Multimedia object's metadata edition form</font></div>

#### 2.2.2.3 Tags

This tag allows you to catalogue multimedia objects depending on the defined categories. You can add, edit and delete categories at any time through this module. Knowledge areas are divided in domains. A multimedia object can be catalogued in more that one knowledge area at the same time.

In the interface, where you can observe an entry for each type of area, there are two lists; the second one with all knowledge areas of this type and the first one with the areas in which the multimedia object is catalogued. If you want to catalogue a multimedia object in a specific area, you just have to select it in the second list and click on the
arrow which points to the first list. If you want to change the catalogue of a multimedia object, you have to do the opposite. To increase the speed of cataloguing, the previous process can be simplified in making double click in the area.

If the areas of knowledge will be the same for all the multimedia objects of a series, it is recommended to modify this value in "Videos Template" tag of that series. With this, every new multimedia object of the series will have this value when it is created.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_3bd61557.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 21. Multimedia object’s tags tab</font></div>


#### 2.2.2.4 People

As the “Tags” tag, the area to catalogue people is divided in blocks, corresponding each block to each of the roles that a person can have inside a video. There is an entry for each role and inside that there is a list of people related to the multimedia object. You can modify the order of the people listed in each role with the arrows in the list. You can also edit the attributes of the people, without using the people module (directly from the multimedia objects administrator). In addition, you can decouple a person from the multimedia object. If you decouple a person which is not related to another multimedia object, it gets deleted from the database. In the “new” button, you can insert a new person or an existing person in the object.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_41cbe086.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 22. Multimedia object’s people tab</font></div>


If you click on the “new” button, you access to a form where you can write the name of people you wish to add; while you are typing the name, you can see a list with catalogued people with this name in the database. For example, after typing “ruben” you will see listed all “Rubén” in the database and after typing «ruben go» you will only see listed those people with a surname which starts with “go” as González or Gómez. After typing the full name, if the person is already in the database, he or she will be listed. After selecting him/her and press the “use” button, he/she will be linked to the multimedia object. If he or she is not in the database, after typing you will not see a list and you would click on the “new” buttom to finish filling the data of the person and linking him/her to the multimedia object. You have to be careful with the position you give to the people because it’s not the same Rubén González González as a student or as a programmer.

The next image illustrates this process:

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m5b9ec300.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 23. People search form</font></div>


#### 2.2.2.5 Technical metadata

The last tag of the multimedia object technical metadata is made up of four entries:

-   *Images*: List of images linked to the multimedia object. You can modify its order, delete them or insert new images. See section 2.2.3.

-   *Video files*: List of multimedia files of the multimedia object. You can create new ones, modify, arrange, preview or delete them.

-   *Materials*: List of materials of the multimedia object. You can create new ones, modify, arrange or delete them.

-   *Links*: List of links of the multimedia object. You can create new ones, modify, arrange or delete them.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_6fdd7353.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 24. Multimedia object’s multimedia tab</font></div>


##### 2.2.2.5.1 **Download a master and a publishing copy of a mono-stream video**

For those videos that are not imported from Opencast, you can download a copy of the master and publication file of the recording on this tab.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_m594847d7.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 25. Download a video</font></div>


We can see from video files to various icons appear to us before the name and identifier of the video. If you click on the arrow icon down, it downloads a copy of this video.

This would also be true for SBS generated from imported files from Opencast.

### 2.3.2 Series and multimedia object image edition

This module is used by the series module and the multimedia object module to list images linked to different multimedia objects or series. This also allows you to link new images.

Both series and multimedia objects have a certain number of little representative images, mainly obtained from a frame of the video or the logo of which you record. These images can be arranged from the “Multimedia” tab in order to change the order in which they appear on the Web portal.

There are three different ways to link new images:

-   Indicating the URL of the image: This is used to indicate an existing image in another HTTP server.

-   Uploading a local image: Uploading a new image of the client server is the most used method. These images are resized in the server to save space and reduce the bandwidth needed to show the portal.

-   Using an existing image: The last used images are listed in pages so you could reuse them. You can advance throughout the different pages with the “previous” and “next” buttons.

These three methods to link images correspond to the three parts of the form to insert images. You can see it afterwards.

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 27. Multimedia object’s picture options</font></div>


An image can be linked to more than a multimedia object. If an image is decoupled of an item, but it is linked to another one, it is not deleted. If it is only linked to an item, when it is decoupled, it will be deleted.

At the multimedia objects management module, the new thumbnail can be selected in two different ways:

-   If the content of the multimedia object is a video, you can extract thumbnail from the video frames. Using the "Photo" button, an image will be extracted at the selected instant of the video.

## 2.3 Content publication

The content publication is carried out through the publication tag of the edition form in the multimedia objects module. The publication is conducted for each multimedia object in unique and independent way.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_14aa138b.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 31. Multimedia object’s publication tab</font></div>


There are different publication channels where you can publish multimedia objects. A multimedia object can be published in one or several defined channels. When a publication channel is selected, before publishing it, the file is coded to the needed profile. Multimedia objects are not published until this transcoding is finished.

As well as the publication channels, in order to not to publish a multimedia object, you have the state, whose default value is regular. You can modify the state of a blocked multimedia object so it can’t be accessible in any channel. The utility of the channel is allowing you to unpublish a multimedia object of all publication channels in a temporary way.

You can also define access profiles for the videos and select them in the last pull-down menu. A profile can be public or private. In this private profile, you have to define a password.

## 2.4 Other administration modules

The administrative application also has other modules to perform less common administrative tasks than the publication and administration of live videos. In this section, the different existing modules will be summarized.

### 2.4.1 Access module

It is a module to have access to the application of administration. The interface is simply an access form, which is used to validate the login and the password with the list of users of the server database.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_34781e32.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 36. Live channels configuration</font></div>


-   Name: Live channel name shown in the frontend.

-   Description: Information about the channel.

-   URL: Streaming server’s Url. This Url uses a rtmp protocol. We recommend using the AMS technology (Adobe Media Server) because it delivers multimedia content to desk and mobile devices. The Url by default is rtmp://\<URL\>/livepkgr .

It also supports FMS technology (Flash Media Server) and WMS technology (Windows Media Services).

-   STREAM: Name that identifies the video flow on the streaming server.

-   Status: There are two possible states for the channel:

    -   Live broadcasting: Enables the live streaming on the channel.

    -   On Hold: Disables the live streaming on the channel. It can be configured to play videos (waiting playlist) while there is not any live streaming on the channel.

**NOTE**: When the live streaming source is not available it is recommended to change the channel state to “On Hold”.

-   Technology: It supports FMS technology (Flash Media Server) and WMS technology (Windows Media Services). To use AMS technology you have to choose FMS. AMS is the new version of FMS that delivers multimedia content to mobile devices.

-   Resolution: Player resolution of the live channel on the Web TV portal.

-   Qualities: It allows multi-quality streams. Multi-quality streams are useful to deliver video streaming to slow Internet connections or mobile devices. Width band in kbps and width in pixels. If the width band is not configured, by default is set up to 1 Mbps.

-   IP Source: IP address of the streaming server. This parameter configures the live channel to stream only from the Ip address introduced.

-   Index play: The live streaming is announced in the Home site while it is happening. A live event must be created and configured with date and duration.

#### 2.4.4.2 Streaming encoder configuration

The streaming encoder delivers multimedia content to the streaming server. The streaming server relies the multimedia content to the user’s desktop computers and mobile devices. We recommend Adobe Media Server (AMS) as Pumukit live streaming server.

As streaming encoder Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FME), Wirecast and other applications can be used.

Streaming encoder configuration recommendations for AMS:

-   Select AMS technology

-   Select H.264 video codec with the following parameters:

    -   Profile: Main

    -   Level: 4.1

    -   Keyframe Frecuency: 4 seconds

-   Select AAC audio codec if available. AAC format is fully compatible with desktop computers, Android and iOS devices. Mp3 format at 44100 Hz sample rate can also be used but it might have problems with older devices (iPad 1).

### 2.4.5 Live events module

It is a module that allows you to administrate the next events that will be broadcasted through real-time channels.

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 38. Encoder jobs module</font></div>


### 2.4.7 People module

It is a module to administrate data of people linked to a multimedia object, whether they present a lecture, they are short-film actors or they have a much more technical role as producers, directors, etc. People are linked to the multimedia object through the roles that are administrated in their corresponding module.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_b337d.png)

<div align="center"><font size=1 color="Blue">Figure 39. People module</font></div>


This module allows the creation, edition and elimination of information related to people. It also should be noted that the information storage in the database is not linked to the person but to the position. This is to say that a person with two different positions have two different entries, one per position. This is because we want to solve the problem of temporary positions as Chancellor of the University. This person has two entries: one for Chancellor and another for teacher.

### 2.4.8 Tags module

It is a module that allows you to administrate Tags areas used to catalogue multimedia objects.

![](images/PuMuKit_2_Content_Admin_Guide_v1.1_html_305eb328.png)
