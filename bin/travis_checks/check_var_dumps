# Finds console.log() calls for javascript code
# TODO: This grep is excluding the 'public' directories on purpose, although most of the js code is there.
#       The issue is that there are external libraries with console.logs on their code as of now, and since we don't
#       use a dependencies manager for web assets (bower, jam, ...) those libraries are included in the code.
